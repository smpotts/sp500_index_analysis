# S&P 500 Index Analysis
The S&P 500 Index (Standard and Poor's 500), is a stock market index tracking the stock performance of 500 of the largest companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States. This project uses the Plotly Dash framework to visualize publicly available data for companies listed on the S&P 500 index. These data sets come from [DataHub.io](https://datahub.io/). DataHub.io makes is easy to load the source data into Pandas data frames to use in visualizations.

## Running the app
To get this Dash app running, run the Python application, and open a browser window to http://127.0.0.1:8050/.

## Next Steps
I would like to expand the scope of data provided in this analysis. For now, it includes the S&P 500 index data and the CBOE VIX Volatility index data, but I would like to incorporate data from other indexes in the U.S. stock market.
